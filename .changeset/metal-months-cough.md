'@leafygreen-ui/date-picker': patch
---

Reduces the width and height of the calendar icon so that the focus/hover states do not excessively overflow the input container. 
When the `size` is `xsmall` the width and hight of the calendar icon will be `20px`. When the `size`is `small` the width and hight of the calendar icon will be 22px. The icon itself will remain the the same size.
