'@leafygreen-ui/icon': minor

Adds `isGlyph` property to icons returned by `createIconComponent`. This means the generic `<Icon/>` component will now be compatible with Select and Combobox Options.
Additionally, overloads `isComponentGlyph` function to accept either a `ReactNode`, or `ComponentType`.
