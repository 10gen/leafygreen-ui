'@leafygreen-ui/menu': minor

- Creates the `MenuDescendant` component, a replacement for `FocusableMenuItem`. By wrapping an input component in `MenuDescendant`, it will be registered as a menu item descendant, and will be focusable using standard menu arrow key interactions.
- Marks `FocusableMenuItem` as deprecated - this will be removed in a future release
