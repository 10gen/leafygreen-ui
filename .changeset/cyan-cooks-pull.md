Adds `glyph` prop to component, which can be supplied instead of a trigger prop, to render the Tooltip's trigger as an IconButton wrapping the supplied glyph. This is designed to make it easier to render LeafyGreenUI Icons as triggers for Tooltip components. Note: This prop is an alternative to the `trigger` prop, and deference is given to the `trigger` prop.
