'@leafygreen-ui/button': minor

- The default outline shown by the browser is no longer shown when a button is focused. Instead, a custom interaction ring will be displayed that conforms to LeafyGreen-UI style guidelines whenever the button is hovered or focused.
- Button now has a `darkMode` prop which for now only controls the interaction ring color.
