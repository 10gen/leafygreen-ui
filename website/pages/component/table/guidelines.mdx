Info tables display static data, and editable tables, are editable (like a spreadsheet).

The header of both these types of tables is the same. You can use the sort icons to sort columns in descending or ascending order. By default these columns are unsorted.

A menu trigger can be added to each column header, for example to allow the user to delete a column.

When your info table spans more than 10 rows you should alternate the background color of each row, so that your table is more scannable.

Do not use the alternating background pattern when there are fewer than 10 line items in your table. Otherwise it may look like one of the rows is selected or disabled.
