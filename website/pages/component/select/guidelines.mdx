Select inputs are typically used alongside other form elements like toggles, radio boxes, or text inputs when a user needs to make a selection from a list of items.

Select inputs are not menus. In a menu, a user takes an action (like copy/delete a property or navigate to a different section/screen). In a select input, a selection is being made — the user’s selection will be shown after a selection is made (unlike with the menu).

    margin: 40px 0;
    width: 100%;
  `}
/>

In a select input where there are less than 3-4 items, consider using radio boxes, or radio inputs instead.

Select inputs come in various sizes. We recommend limiting the use of the XS size. Default size supports 16px body font as well as 14px body font.

Use labels to organize groups of items.

Unlike buttons, there is no primary or secondary select input. Use a progressive disclosure pattern so as to emphasize the input the user should interact with before surfacing other UI elements. (For example, for a billing form, show the country select input before surfacing the state select input, since not all countries have states.)

When the user selects the default prompt text in the dropdown they are making a null selection, or in other words not making a selection.
